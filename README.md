This Project has been developed to detect Tumor in the Brain's MRI Scans and classify it's type if any tumor is detected.
There are 3 main types of tumors namely **adenomas, meningioma** and **glioma**. Read about them on Google :)

The data was collected from **Bahawal Victoria Hospital, Bahawalpur, Pakistan**. The credit for the data collection goes to Mr Salman Qadri and his teammates.It was a part of their research.

I added images that found no Tumor in the MRI Scan for a just classification as the data wasn't a part of this original dataset.
I downloaded Images that contain no tumor from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri

If you want to test it without running the code, I have saved the model in a .keras file. You can load it and use it for predictions on your data. I have provided its link below since the file can't be uploaded on GitHub due to it's size.

At the moment, I have other projects to tend to. When I have time, I plan to create an app for it.
